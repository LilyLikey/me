Q: Do you ship internationally?<br />A: Please send me an email regarding any international orders.<br /><br />Q: Do you do refunds?<br />A: All sales are final. If there is an issue regarding your issue where you believe a refund/partial refund/exchange or return is needed, please send me an email so we can work something out.<br /><br />Q: What is your processing and shipping timeliness?<br />A: please give me 5-7 business days to send out your order! If your order has tracking, you will get it within that time frame or sooner. Once I hand over the packages to the carrier (USPS, UPS, Fedex) the time frame of delivery is no longer within my hands, so I cannot give a delivery timeframe for that.
